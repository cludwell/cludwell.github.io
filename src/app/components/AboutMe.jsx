Prior to transitioning into software engineering, I worked as a Senior Solar Panel Installer, specializing in residential solar installations. This role required a keen attention to detail and the ability to find creative solutions within tight time frames. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for creative problem-solving and my desire for a career that constantly challenges me to learn and grow.  While I may be a career transitioner and not the traditional Computer Science graduate, I bring soft skills and experiences a graduate might lack, such as mission impact, quick turnaround, and building experiences clients love.`}
