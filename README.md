##Thanks for checking out my portfolio!

##Software Engineer

It felt strange to me when I graduated from my bootcamp that the staff encouraged us to use a template for our portfolios. If you can't build a portfolio site are you really a software engineer?! So I decided to remake mine.

I used Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React.js, and just a little anime.js, though I might add more in the future. My intention was to use this opportunity to learn more about anime.js, but I realized I could deploy faster using what I already know of React and Tailwind.

I will improve the responsiveness of the design in the near future.

If you decide to build your own statically hosted Next.js project on Github Pages make sure that you check out my nextjs.config.js file and comment out these two lines from the .yml file that github generates.

```
# - name: Static HTML export with Next.js
#   run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.runner }} next export
```

Please reach out to me with any work opportunities.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
